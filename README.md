# GitHub for Startups

[GitHub for Startups](https://github.com/enterprise/startups/) helps your startup go from idea to IPO, offering access to the world's largest and most advanced developer platform. Qualifying startups receive access to 20 seats for GitHub Enterprise for 12 months, and 50% off for the next 12 months. To further aid your onboarding process, we're creating a series of video presentations to answer your questions, provide guidance about DevOps, and walkthrough our most popular offerings.

This space is designed as a companion to the video presentations, helping to provide an overview of the concepts and serve as a launching point to the GitHub documentation. It is currently a work in progress, evolving as we launch more content, receive feedback, and products change. Please provide [feedback](/issues) or make a [pull request](/pulls) to aid the shaping of this content and support the community.

## How GitHub uses GitHub

In our first video presentation we will help your organization explore DevOps practices by answering one of the most common questions we receive - "[How does GitHub use GitHub](/how-github-uses-github.md)?" We'll start by walking through the full lifecycle of software development, from ideation to writing code to deployment (and back to the beginning). You'll see how to manage projects with GitHub, drive conversations about features, and configure repositories, branches and pull requests.

## Automating repetitive processes

Manual processes are the bane of any developer's existence. It takes them out of the flow, introduces additional work, and has a high likelihood of being bypassed. GitHub Actions can [enable automation](automation.md) for your processes, from running tests to deploying to production and everything in between. You'll explore the marketplace to take advantage of Actions created by the community, and common tasks best managed by GitHub Actions.
